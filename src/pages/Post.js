            Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and welcome! I'm participating in the #HasuraHackathon
            and in this article, I will be writing about the App I built and how
            I built it. But firstly, allow me to talk about the inspiration
            behind the App The Inspiration The App which I will call JobTracker
            is majorly for aspiring programmers (like myself) who are on a goal
            to secure their first "Tech" job. I noticed that in my attempts to
            secure a Tech job so far, it has become overwhelming keeping track
            of the requirements in each job ad I come across. There's always
            that one important job requirement that I don't have which prevents
            me from applying for the job. So I started thinking of different
            ways I could keep track of job details and requirements so that I
            can set goals around the most important one. That way, if I can
            confidently tick the boxes for the important ones, I can overcome my
            imposter syndrome and apply for that dream job I've long been
            waiting for.
